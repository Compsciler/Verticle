# Verticle

Vertically guess the word in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to 
the letter <strong>in that column position</strong> for the word.

Imagine the solution word being placed in the bottom row and 
the color of the letters in the grid apply to the word below.
(If you reach the 6th guess, it will be spelled horizontally and will be colored normally.)
